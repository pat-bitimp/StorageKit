StorageKit
==========

	StorageKit is an ORM Library for Objective-C using the ObjFW Framework.

	Rules:
		* Properties have to be OFObject or SKObject. (just descriptions are saved in db!)
		* Property names are generated by macro: SK(propertyName)
		* Do _NOT_ overwrite description of SKObject

	Currently it offers just drivers for PGSql. MySQL and SQLite are planned.
